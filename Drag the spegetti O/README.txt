This is a game I made for practice, and it's not meant to be very good or fun. Anyway, use WASD to move the 'I' and push the 'O' into the 'x' aka the goal.
You can drag the 'O' by holding shift. This game was compiled on a Raspberry Pi, so if you want to run it on something else, compile it youself ;)
Enjoy.
