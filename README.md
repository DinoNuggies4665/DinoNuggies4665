Hello, I like making games in C++. My PC is a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS so don't expect me to compile anything for Windows. I'm currently working on a RPG in C++ with text sprites, eventually I'll use pixel sprites, but I'm still new to C++ so this is my life right now. Welp that concludes my README file, so bye!
